This is a trial project for an online Bursary Application system for the NG-CDF

It works as follows:
Applications are received and cross-checked automatically by comparing the provided ID card number in the form to a Database "assumed to be from the IEBC".
It will contain names, ID numbers and the location of voters. If an ID number is found out to be of a voter from another constituency, the form is sent to an inbox where the Admin can review manually.
If the form is valid, it is automatically filled into google spreadsheets.

Duplicate files are judged from the name of school, and the admission number. They will be rejected upon detection.
